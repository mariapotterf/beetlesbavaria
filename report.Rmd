# Research questions

Q1: Variation of beetle population dynamics over time and space: 

 - Do beetle counts vary between trap pairs? 
 - How do beetle counts change over time and space?
   - Sum beetle counts per trap/year
 - Does beetle population increase earlier in the year? When does the main increase in population (*swarming*) happen?
   - Identify day of the year (DOY) of the maximal difference in beetle counts between two consecutive dates.
 - Do beetles aggregate faster? When they reach the same threshold? (1000 beetles) *aggregation*
   - Identify (DOY) of reaching the 1000 beetles per trap.
   
Q2: Regional vs global variation? - run on 'sum of beetles/year' variable (posible to run on other dependent variables as well)

- are the traps near by more similar than the traps further away?
- LISA - local indicators of spatial association
- Global Moran's I - global indicators of spatial autocorrelation
- variograms - identifies the distance at what two random location are equally different (their difference does not further increase with increasing distance)

Q3: Drivers? (data collected, but not analyzed yet)

- temperature
- precipitation
- soil water content (swvl) - ratio volume water/volume soil: higher the number, more water, less drought
- elevation
- spruce%



# Methods

## Input data

### Beetle trap dataset overview

- trap datasets in trap pairs, covering area of Bavaria over 2015-2021
- cca 10 x 10 km span, 1 km distance one trap from the other in one location
- consistent monitoring: 79*2= 158 traps/year per whole research period
- removed traps without pair (e.g. '3'), also traps that were added later in the study period (mostly in Bavarian forests, north-west Bavaria)
- traps emptied over whole year, roughtly in two weeks interval (range 7 - 30 days)
- filtered trap data from April 1st to Oct 30th
- individual trap name = 'falsto_name' - one trap can have several globalid, if moved over years. Keep only one globalid per trap. Only one 'globalid' for traps locations.





### Dependent variables

- total sum of beetles per trap/year
- beetle **emergence**: the max difference in beetle counts between two consecutive dates 
- beetle **aggregation** : DOY of the beetles reaching 1000 beetles/trap.






```{r summary-tab, caption = 'Summary table f the beetle counts per year and predictors '}
ips_sum_preds %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(spei1, spei3, spei6, spei12, tpi, tri )) %>% 
summary()

```


```{r p_clim_data, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3, fig.cap= "Red line indicates local mean."}

ggarrange(p_temp, p_prec)

#cowplot::plot_grid(p_temp, p_prec)
```

## Data processing

### Curate the data 

- vegetation period: April 1st to Oct 30 (DOY start `r doy.start` - DOY end `r doy.end`)
- removed:

  + if revisit times is less then 5 per season
  + zero beetles cough per whole season 
  + trap number 3 (not a pair: 1 or 2)
  + only kept consistent traps, they were surveyed per whole period 2015-2021 -> 79*2 traps in total (158)



### Identify multicollinearity between predictors

VIF - variance inflation factor
values for each predictor variable in the model to determine if multicollinearity

Based on VIF values:

 - less 1  - relatively independent
 - 1-5  - very little dependent
 - more 5  - likely concerning - removed

Based on VIF values, I have removed the most correlated predictors.

Set of the least correlated predictors, which can be further used for analysis:

```{r p_vif_fin, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3.5, echo = F, fig.cap="Values of the selected predictors based on the low (<5) values of Variance Inflation Factors. Vertical line represent value 1, indicating non-correlated precictors."}

vif_values_fin

#create horizontal bar chart to display each VIF value
barplot(vif_values_fin, main = "VIF Values", horiz = TRUE, col = "steelblue")

#add vertical line at 5
abline(v = 1, lwd = 3, lty = 2)


```

### Check correlation for selected predictores 



```{r lm_temp_elev, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, echo = F, fig.cap="Correlation between known predictors: elevation vs temperature"}

df_predictors_year %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp,
             y = elev,
             group = year)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c( "R2", 'p'))) + #"eq",
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(.~year) + #, scales = 'free'
  theme_bw()

```


```{r lm_prec_elev, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, echo = F, fig.cap="Correlation between known predictors: precipitation vs elevation" }

df_predictors_year %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prec,
             y = elev,
             group = year)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c( "R2", 'p'))) + #"eq",
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(.~year) + #, scales = 'free'
  theme_bw()

```


```{r lm_prec_freq, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, echo = F, fig.cap="Correlation between known predictors: precipitation vs spruce share" }

# precipitation vs spruce share
df_predictors_year %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prec,
             y = freq,  # share of spruce
             group = year)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  #stat_poly_eq(use_label(c( "R2", 'p'))) + #"eq",
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(.~year) + #, scales = 'free'
  theme_bw()

```

```{r lm_temp_freq, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, echo = F, fig.cap="Correlation between known predictors: temperature vs spruce share (freq)" }

# temp vs spruce share
df_predictors_year %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp,
             y = freq,  # share of spruce
             group = year)) +
  stat_poly_line() +
  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c( "R2", 'p'))) + #"eq",

## Local vs regional variation

### LISA: measure of similarity between trap and its surrounding

10 nearest distance neighbors
LISA identifies the (di)similarity in beetles counts/trap between neighbouring traps 

Categories: 

- High-High - hotspot, having relatively high value, cluster
- High-Low - dissimilar values from neighours
- Low-High - dissimilar values from neighours 
- Low-Low - coldspots, similar to neighbors

Individual years were sliced, so he yearly hotspots vs coldspots are classified within the respective year.


```{r p_lisa_sub, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, echo = F, fig.cap="Local Indicators of Spatial Assotiation. Shown are only High-High and Low-Low clusters. No significat values are not shown."}

p_lisa_sub  

```

How many traps are similar vs dissimilar over years?

- share of 'high-high' increases over years
- lowest dissimilarity between traps: 2020, highest in 2016

```{r p_lisa_freq, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5, echo = F, fig.cap="Local Indicators of Spatial Assotiation. Frequency of the similarity categories per trap: High-High, High-Low, Low-High, Low-Low"}

p_lisa_freq +
  theme_bw()

```

### Global Moran's I - overall measure of spatial autocorrelation over Bavaria

```{r p_glob_moran_bar, fig.width = 2.5, fig.height = 2.5, echo = F, fig.cap="Global Moran's I per each year. Higher value indicates higher autocorrelation"}

p_glob_moran_bar  

```

### Semivariance
```{r semi_out, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, echo = F, fig.cap="Variograms per year. Note the different variogram fitting (line)"}

semi_out  

```
