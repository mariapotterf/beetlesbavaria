# Analyze the data:

#-	Do beetle data correlate with Cornelius data? By hexagons??
#    -   
#    - 	Is there less beetles if there is more deciduous trees?
# 
#-	Effects of drought: 
#    -	Is there more beetles from 2018? Eg.g. drought will trigger beetle population
#    - compare the counts between years    
# -	Effect of sampling design: do I get the same results given the random selection of two traps?


# run analyses on 3km grid:

# First check the all damage together, then distribute it by years
